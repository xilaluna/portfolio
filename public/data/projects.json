    "description": "BoringStocks was a collaboration project where I worked with a team of coders to create a lightweight stock information site that’s designed to be lightning fast. Specifically, I programmed the back-end, connecting the web application to our in house API. Furthermore my team and I wanted to finish the application on a short schedule so we opted to use an agile methodology to ensure our productivity was at its most efficient.",
