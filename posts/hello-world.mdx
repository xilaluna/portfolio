description: A little bit about me and what I do.
---

Hello world, my name is Xila Luna. I am a goal-oriented individual capable of delivering project efficiency and effective communication. Specifically, I excel in full-stack engineering.

I grew up in the Bay Area, where I was lucky enough to be at a high school that was offering [CodeNation](https://codenation.org/) classes. I later joined my school's robotics team. Due to my involvement in being in a robotics team, I began to develop a passion for programming.

Growing up as a low-income Latino, I found it necessary to accomplish higher education and gain a career that would ensure stability. I have witnessed my parents work tirelessly to make ends meet for the security of our family. They have always wanted me to be something better than them, a doctor, a lawyer, a programmer. By pursuing computer science I am not only challenging the societal norms of a stereotypical Latino male, but I am also ensuring myself and my familyâ€™s future well-being.
